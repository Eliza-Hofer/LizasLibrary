# From Scrap to Server: Repurposing End-of-Life Electronics

### Introduction

This project documents my hands-on initiative to combat electronic waste by fully restoring, upgrading, and repurposing discarded or non-functioning computer hardware. The overall objective was twofold: to practice **low-level hardware troubleshooting and maintenance** and to demonstrate a practical approach to **sustainable computing**.

The focus was on a haul of [Specify the type of hardware, e.g., three discarded laptops, ten network switches, an old desktop PC]. The initial status of the hardware was [Describe the condition, e.g., non-booting, heavy cosmetic damage, missing essential components]. The restoration process covered everything from component diagnosis to operating system installation and final deployment.

### Key Tools & Skills

* **Software:** Linux (Ubuntu/Debian), custom shell scripting, low-level disk utilities.
* **Hardware:** Soldering, multimeter usage, thermal paste replacement, BIOS flashing.
* **Outcome:** [e.g., A low-power home server, a public access terminal, a network monitoring station].

### Phase 1: Diagnostics and Repair

The first step involved systematically diagnosing the failure points. [Describe the first specific repair, e.g., The primary failure was a faulty capacitor on the motherboard, requiring replacement.]
