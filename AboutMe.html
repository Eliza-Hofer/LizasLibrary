	<p> Since I was 9 I have been obsessed with computers and the internet. I have been using linux for over half of my life now, and now I use Arch (btw). I am a senior studying ICT and Russian language, and intend to continue my education, by aiming to get a double major and going to grad school. I am a huge fan of open source development, and enjoy writing and customizing neovim plugins. Outside of computers I play Magic: The Gathering and even occasionally skateboard. I also have a personal philosophy about code. I see it as an art more than a science. I feel like code gives us a new type of canvas that gives us absolute control of every aspect of our work, allowing us to create entirely new worlds and experiences.</p>
